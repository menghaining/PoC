## Exploit Description
Suffering from CWE613-Insufficient Session Expiration. 
When user1 who was already logged in is disabled, user1 will still have access to the application even after he is disabled.
The session of the disabled user is still alive, allowing the user to use the old session to operate successfully.

### PoC
1. `admin` login, `user1` login
2. `admin` **disable** `user1` through
```
POST /api/admin/user/changeStatus
```
3. `user1` can still operate successfully, like updating his/her information, and deleting other normal users.
